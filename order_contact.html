<p>I started my path of edged tools and weapons, in my Grandfather's sharpening and machine shop. In 1979, at the age of 6 years old, I was taught how to sharpen blades of many various sizes and shapes. That became my Saturday morning job. This quickly grew into a desire to make my own knife and in a few months, it had begun. I was making my first knife in the late fall of 1979. We also had a friend that made knives for 60+ years (Delbert Clark of Clark Knives) and he took to showing me his tricks and techniques. I was using old saw blades from the local saw mill, at that time. From annealing the steel to a workable state, cutting it to size, to forge heating, pounding it into shape, hand filing, heat treating and tempering, I learned it all that year. Fast forward to today. Sadly, those that mentored me have passed and times have changed. I have lost count of how many knives and tools I have made and often wish I had numbered them, as they did. Today, I use sheets of material, I still cut it in a variety of ways, some are pounded out, most are done with stock removal, I do all of my heat treat and tempering processes (methods depend on the material used) and I hand finish each knife. </p>
<br>
<p>As with any hobby, it grew and has come to encompass more types of gear and useful items. From knives, came a need for sheaths of leather and kydex. That grew into a kit option for some special orders, for a complete survival kit on your belt. And the snowball keeps growing. However, quality has remained the key factor of my work. I strive to offer items that are pleasing to the eye, capable of hard work and will last long enough to pass on to generations to follow.</p>
